## Why do we need to estimate a study sample size?

- The correct sample size is a balance between a study that is too small or too large

- If the sample size is too small we will not be able to show an existing difference between the two arms (false negative result) because of a lack of precision

- If the sample size is too large:
    - the costs of the study will be excessive
    - it is unethical to expose too much patients
    - we will have difficulties to recruit patients

## Reminder about statistical tests

- The purpose of a statistical test is to test a **null hypothesis** $H_0$ about a parameter of the population

- The **null hypothesis** $H_0$ is the one that we want to reject. It often expresses a lack of effect. For example: the effect of the treatment is the same in the control and in the intervention arm

- The **alternative hypothesis** $H_a$ is the one that we want to accept. For example: the effect of the treatment is different in both arms

## Reminder about statistical tests

- There is two errors that can be made with a statistical test

- Type I error: rejecting $H_0$ when it is true. False-positive result. It has a probability of $\alpha$

- Type II error: not rejecting $H_0$ when it is false, i.e. when $H_a$ is true. False-negative result. It has a probability of $\beta$

## Reminder about statistical tests

| Decision             | $H_0$ true              | $H_a$ true              |
| ---------------------|-------------------------| ------------------------|
| Reject  $H_0$        | type I error ($\alpha$) | 1- $\beta$              |
| Do not reject  $H_0$ | 1-$\alpha$              | type II error ($\beta$) |


- The **power** of a statistical test is 1- $\beta$. It is the probability of detecting a statistically significant difference when a difference of given magnitude really exists

## Example 

- Randomized double-blind controlled trial carried out to compare inhaled corticosteroids with placebo in school-age children.
